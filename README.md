# Turbulence-Generation-Using-Wavelets
Data set and code of Turbulence Generation Paper
This project contains the code and generated data in paper "Turbulence Generation from a stochastic wavelet model", with url:https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.02397. 

Data description: 
1. File "iso_velocity_193.txt" contains the velocity data of generated isotropic homogeneous turbulence in a box with size 4\pi * \4\pi * 4\pi, six colums from left to right are: X coordinates, Y coordinates, Z coordinates, U velocity, V velocity, W velocity.
